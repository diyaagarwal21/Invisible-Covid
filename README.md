# Invisible-Covid

Hello! Welcome to Invisible COVID!
This game is a maze-based game to help remind people to:
 - wear their mask
 - use sanitizer
 - be conscious of people around you
during the pandemic!

HOW TO PLAY:
There will be invisible COVID in different parts of each location.
Try to navigate the maze without touching the invisible COVID!
Finish the specific tasks in each room (3 total rooms), and see if you test COVID + or – 
Don’t forget to pick up your mask and sanitizer (task 1). Use your sanitizer frequently to prevent getting COVID.
One time during the whole game, you can use a powerup, which shows the invisible COVID for 5 SECONDS ONLY!

*Use WASD to navigate*

Have fun playing!
